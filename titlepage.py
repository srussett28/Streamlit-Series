st.write("""
I call myself a "data weirdo" because my journey into data has been anything but traditional. It all started with Excel, where I dived deep into VBA and macros to automate tasks and solve complex problems. But instead of graduating directly to SQL, I took a Business Analytics course at USC that introduced me to R. My early days in R were focused on regression analysis and building predictive models that provided actionable insights for users.
However, I didn’t start by learning the foundational structures of data or the x’s and o’s. I was thrown straight into the deep end, tackling applied problems from the start. Just as I was getting comfortable with R, I pivoted to Python—a shift that significantly expanded my toolkit and marked the start of my career as a consultant and solutions specialist.
In consulting, I wasn’t just coding or analyzing data—I was designing end-to-end solutions. My role demanded that I be a data engineer, architect, and data scientist all at once. Clients wanted to understand the algorithms, how their users would interact with them, and how these solutions would integrate into existing systems to drive optimization.
This unconventional learning path and multifaceted role shaped me into a versatile professional with a unique perspective on data. It’s why I don’t fit neatly into any one category and why this series reflects that bringing together insights from data analytics, data science, and engineering for anyone who feels like they don’t belong in just one box either.
